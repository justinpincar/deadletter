<h2 class="content-subhead">Error: Browser not supported</h2>

<p>
Reason: We need a cryptographically secure PRNG to be implemented (i.e. the window.crypto method)
</p>

<p>
Solution: Use Chrome &gt;= 11, Safari &gt;= 3.1 or Firefox &gt;= 21
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, you can't use the full functionality of deadletter with your current browser. However, you can still use the quick note service.
